Discordia-examples
===================================

I am making this because i remember how pissed i was when i tried to use undocumented or poorly documented extensions related to discordia

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   The examples aren't perfect but they cover enough for anyone to use it
